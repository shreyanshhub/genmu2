**Eleni Triantafillou** is a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. Previously, she obtained her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto. Her research is centered around techniques for adapting / updating models in both directions: inserting "knowledge" (transfer learning, domain adaptation, few-shot learning) and removing outdated, harmful or unwanted "knowledge". She was the lead author of a well-adopted benchmark for few-shot learning and has expertise in devising evaluation protocols. She also co-authored two papers on unlearning this year and is involved in several projects on this topic.

She is co-founder and president of ChaLearn, a non-profit organisation dedicated to challenges in machine learning. Her areas of expertise include computer vision and bioinformatics. Prior to joining Paris-Saclay she worked as an independent consultant and was a researcher at ATT Bell Laboratories, where she pioneered applications of neural networks to pen computer interfaces (with collaborators including Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio) and co-invented with Bernhard Boser and Vladimir Vapnik Support Vector Machines (SVM), which became a textbook machine learning method. She worked on early applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to handwriting recognition in the 1990s. She is also the primary inventor of SVM-RFE, a variable selection technique based on SVM. The SVM-RFE paper has thousands of citations and is often used as a reference method against which new feature selection methods are benchmarked. She also authored a seminal paper on feature selection that received thousands of citations. She organised many challenges in Machine Learning since 2003 supported by the EU network Pascal2, NSF, and DARPA, with prizes sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Disney Research, and Texas Instrument. She was a leader in the organisation of the AutoML and AutoDL challenge series https://autodl.chalearn.org/ and the meta-learning challenge series https://metalearning.chalearn.org/.
