Hi everyone,

The competition has now ended. You can read about winning submissions in [kaggle's discussion board](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-2023-machine-unlearning/discussion).

We'll soon be releasing more details about the competition, as well as the code for the evaluation metric in the next couple of months. Stay tuned!
